# i3rustus

`i3status` is my own  implementation of [i3status](https://github.com/i3/i3status).
The goal is that I replace i3status with this and build custom tools that are not available in i3status.

This project is not intended for other people to use. It's one of my rust learning projects,
where I am getting to know rust better.

## Requirements

- dbus
- NetworkManager
